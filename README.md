Forgot about this project whas on github 😭

Before building **FPK**, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Make** — used to automate the build process.  
- **C Compiler** — such as `gcc`,or another compatible compiler.

### Linux / macOS
You can install the required tools using your package manager:

```bash
